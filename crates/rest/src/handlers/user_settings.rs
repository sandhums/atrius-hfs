//! Implements a small `application/json` API for an opaque, per-user settings
//! document (theme, default tenant, active FHIR version, recent queries, …):
//!
//! - `GET    /_user/settings` — fetch the document (defaults to `{}`)
//! - `PUT    /_user/settings` — replace the whole document
//! - `PATCH  /_user/settings` — [RFC 7386] JSON merge-patch a subset of keys
//!
//! The endpoints live under a leading-underscore path so they are authenticated
//! (a [`Principal`](helios_auth::Principal) is injected when auth is enabled) but
//! exempt from FHIR scope checks, and invisible to FHIR machinery
//! (`CapabilityStatement`, search, history, export).
//!
//! Each response carries a strong `ETag` (`"{version}"`) — strong because
//! `If-Match` is defined in terms of the strong comparison function, which a
//! `W/` validator can never satisfy. Clients may send `If-Match` on
//! `PUT`/`PATCH` for optimistic concurrency, or `If-None-Match` on `GET` for
//! conditional fetches. The weak form is still *accepted* on `If-Match` for
//! clients built against earlier releases.
