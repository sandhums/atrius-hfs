//! Two-phase dependency-graph resolver and executor, shared by `$sql-run`
//! ([`super::sqlquery`]) and `$sql-export`
//! ([`super::export`] / [`crate::export::in_memory`]).
//!
//! A SQLQuery or SQLView Library names its table sources through
//! `relatedArtifact[type=depends-on]` entries. Before this module existed,
//! only the subject's *direct* dependencies were resolved, and every one had
//! to be a leaf ViewDefinition. A SQLView Library's own SQL result can now
//! serve as a table source for whoever depends on it, so the dependency
//! graph can be several levels deep (`SQLQuery -> SQLView -> SQLView ->
//! ViewDefinition`, etc.) — see design #567.
//!
//! Resolution happens in two phases:
//!
//! - **Phase 1 — plan** ([`build_plan`]): walk the graph iteratively (no
//!   recursion in the Rust call stack), fetching every artifact but running
//!   no SQL. Nodes are deduped by canonical URL, so a dependency shared by
//!   two branches (a diamond) is only visited once. Detects cycles, depth
//!   overflow (fixed at [`MAX_GRAPH_DEPTH`]), unresolvable URLs, artifacts of
//!   the wrong type, SQLView artifacts that violate the profile's
//!   `parameter 0..0` constraint, and label collisions. Every structural
//!   error found is collected — nothing is executed until the whole graph
//!   has been checked — and returned together. On success, produces a
//!   [`GraphPlan`] whose nodes are topologically ordered (leaves first).
//! - **Phase 2 — execution** ([`execute_plan`]): materializes the plan's
//!   nodes in order — leaf ViewDefinitions via the wired `SofRunner`,
//!   interior SQLView nodes by running their own (already-validated) SQL
//!   against the tables materialized so far — then runs the subject's own
//!   SQL. A node shared by multiple edges is materialized once; each edge's
//!   `relatedArtifact.label` becomes a table alias for whichever SQL
//!   references it.
//!
//! [`build_plan`] takes its artifact source through the [`ArtifactFetcher`]
//! trait, so it is fully testable without HTTP or a real storage backend —
//! see the `#[cfg(test)]` module below.
