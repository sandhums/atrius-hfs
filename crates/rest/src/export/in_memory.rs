//! In-memory `ExportJobController` implementation.
//!
//! Each job runs inside a `tokio::spawn` task, bounded by a `Semaphore`.
//! Results are stored in a `DashMap<JobId, JobStatus>`. A tenant may have at
//! most `max_jobs_per_tenant` jobs queued or running at once; `submit` refuses
//! the rest.
//!
//! A job carries a mixture of subjects (see [`ExportWork`]), computed against
//! one snapshot of the data and written into one manifest:
//! - **Views** — each named ViewDefinition is run through the `SofRunner` and
//!   its rows are sharded into output files.
//! - **SQL queries** — each named SQLQuery/SQLView Library's fully-resolved
//!   dependency graph ([`crate::handlers::sof::graph`]'s two-phase resolver)
//!   is materialized into an in-memory SQLite engine — leaf ViewDefinitions
//!   via the `SofRunner`, interior SQLView nodes by running their own
//!   (already-validated) SQL — then the subject's own SQL is executed and
//!   the result rows are sharded into output files.
