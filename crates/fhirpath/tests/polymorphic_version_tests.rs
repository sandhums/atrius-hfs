//! Regression tests for issue #309 — choice-element (`value[x]`) resolution must
//! consult the FHIR version of the resource being evaluated, not the build's
//! default version.
//!
//! # Why these tests are gated on `all(R4, R5)`
//!
//! The defect only exists in a build where more than one FHIR version feature is
//! compiled in: `polymorphic_access::get_polymorphic_fields` looked up the
//! generated `FIELD_TYPES` table for `FhirVersion::default_enabled()` (R4
//! whenever R4 is enabled) rather than for the resource's own version. In a
//! single-version build the default *is* the resource's version, so there is
//! nothing to catch.
//!
//! That configuration is not exotic: release artifacts are built with
//! `cargo build --workspace --all-features --release` (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`),
//! so every shipped binary has R4/R4B/R5/R6 compiled in with `default_enabled()`
//! == R4.
//!
//! # Why `Observation.value` with `valueAttachment`
//!
//! `Observation.valueAttachment` exists in R5 and R6 but **not** in R4 (verified
//! against the generated tables in `crates/fhir/src/r4.rs` / `r5.rs`). Before the
//! fix, evaluating `Observation.value` on an R5 Observation carrying
//! `valueAttachment` consulted the R4 table, found no `Observation.value*` field
//! matching the data — and, because `consulted_field_types` was set on table
//! *existence* rather than on a match, the prefix-scan fallback was skipped too.
//! The element resolved to **Empty**: silent, total loss of the value rather than
//! a merely mis-typed one.
//!
//! A test using `valueQuantity` would prove nothing — it is present in both
//! tables and resolves either way. That is the trap in the issue's own suggested
//! test ("assert both resolve"), which passes on unfixed code.
