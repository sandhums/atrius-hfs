//! Fluent catalog invariants for `locales/{en,es,de}/main.ftl`.
//!
//! Every user-visible string in the HTS UI is a catalog key (#551 D5), and
//! `I18n::t` renders an unknown key *as the key itself* rather than crashing.
//! That failure mode is invisible in a passing render test, so the catalogs
//! are checked structurally here instead:
//!
//! - all three locales define exactly the same key set, so switching language
//!   can never drop a label;
//! - every `.ftl` still parses, so a bad edit fails the ring rather than
//!   silently truncating the catalog at the malformed entry.
//!
//! `en` is the source locale and the fallback, so a key present only in a
//! translation is just as much a bug as one missing from it — it means the
//! English string it was translated from has been removed or renamed.
