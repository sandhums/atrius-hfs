//! The workbench "Raw request and response" fold (#803).
//!
//! Every operation workbench — CodeSystem `$lookup` / `$validate-code` /
//! `$subsumes`, ValueSet `$expand`, ConceptMap `$translate` — ends in the same
//! disclosure: the URL that was called, the `Parameters` resource that was
//! POSTed, and the body that came back. It exists so an operator can reproduce
//! the call by hand, which is why it lives in one struct and one partial
//! (`templates/partials/hts-raw-fold.html`) rather than three copies.
//!
//! Three things were wrong with it before #803, and this module is where two
//! of them are fixed:
//!
//! * The response was kept only on the success path, so a failed lookup —
//!   exactly when the payload is most wanted — showed the URL and nothing
//!   else. [`RawExchange`] now rides the error path, and
//!   [`RawFold::from_exchange`] reads it.
//! * The request body was never shown at all, despite the heading promising
//!   it.
//!
//! The third — the fold not looking like a control — is in the partial.
