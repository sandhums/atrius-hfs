//! Server-rendered, HTMX-first administrative UI for the Helios Terminology
//! Server (HTS).
//!
//! This crate follows the same rules of the road as [`helios_ui`]: handlers
//! parse the request, gather data over the HTS HTTP surface, and render an
//! [`askama`] template. All markup lives in `templates/`; static assets
//! (htmx, CSS, JS) are embedded at compile time via [`rust_embed`] and served
//! by [`axum_embed`], so there is no runtime CDN dependency (#551 D6).
//!
//! Handlers branch on the `HX-Request` header — read through the infallible
//! [`axum_htmx::HxRequest`] extractor — to return an HTML *fragment* for
//! htmx-driven swaps and a *full page* for hard navigations, so the UI
//! degrades to working full-page loads without JavaScript.
//!
//! # Mounting
//!
//! [`router`] returns an [`axum::Router`] meant to be mounted at `/ui` in the
//! HTS binary. The router uses the `/hts` prefix internally, so the resulting
//! URL space is `/ui/hts`, `/ui/hts/code-systems`,
//! `/ui/hts/code-systems/{id}`, `/ui/hts/value-sets`, `/ui/hts/concept-maps`,
//! `/ui/hts/import` and `/ui/hts/capability-statement` — one page tree under
//! the same `/ui` mount point HFS uses.
//!
//! # Upstream contract
//!
//! HTS-UI ships inside the `hts` binary but the handlers still speak HTTP to
//! the HTS REST surface. That keeps the UI honest (every card and cell is
//! what a browser sees), and makes the `HTS_UI_UPSTREAM_URL` override — the
//! canonical degraded-state trigger per design doc §7 — useful without a
//! rebuild. When neither is set the mount site derives a loopback URL from
//! the binary's own host:port. `HFS_TERMINOLOGY_SERVER` is HFS-side and has
//! no meaning here.
//!
//! # Shared chrome and assets
//!
//! The `Assets` embed points at `../ui/assets`: HTS-UI and HFS-UI share CSS
//! and vendored htmx from one place (see design doc §9.2). Extracting those
//! bytes behind a crate boundary is gated on #543.
//!
//! Shared *markup* already lives in [`helios_ui_chrome`], which #799
//! introduced for the topbar account menu — see [`Chrome::user_menu`]. The
//! crate owns templates only, not assets, so the two concerns move on their
//! own schedules.
