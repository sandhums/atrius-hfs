#   HFS_PORT - Port where HFS is running (default: 8080)
#   HFS_HOST - Host where HFS is running (default: localhost)
#   HFS_URL  - Full URL to HFS (overrides HFS_HOST and HFS_PORT)
#
# Examples:
#   ./install.sh                           # Uses localhost:8080
#   HFS_PORT=8088 ./install.sh             # Uses localhost:8088

# Does this server support transaction bundles?
#
# Not every backend can. A transaction is all-or-nothing, which S3 cannot
# provide — it has no atomic multi-object operation — so an s3-elasticsearch
# deployment declines them rather than committing partially (#489). The
# fixtures are all transaction bundles, so on those backends they are rewritten
# to batch bundles first (see to_batch.jq).
#
# Asked, not assumed: the CapabilityStatement is derived from the configured
# backend, so this stays correct as backends are added without the loader
# needing to know their names.

# Verify every resource the fixtures address by a concrete id is retrievable.
#
# A 2xx on the bundle POST is not proof the data landed where the tests expect.
# The batch rewrite once relocated `Patient/85`, `/355`, `/907`, `/908` and
# `/999` onto uuid ids: every POST still returned 2xx, resource counts were
# unchanged, and Inferno still "passed" — because tests for a missing patient
# *skip*, and the gate ignores skips (#491). This asserts the ids directly, so
# that failure mode is loud instead of silent.
#
# Derived from the fixtures rather than hardcoded, so it keeps covering whatever
# ids they use. Only `PUT Type/id` entries are checked: POST-created resources
# get server-assigned ids that nothing addresses by name.
