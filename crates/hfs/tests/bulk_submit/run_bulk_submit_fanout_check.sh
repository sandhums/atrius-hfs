# Manual check of the $bulk-submit file fan-out on SQLite: that the configured
# fan-out is forced down to 1 and announced in the log, and that a full ingest
# finishes cleanly.
#
# Origin: issue #942, "import aborts with 'database is locked' at high file
# concurrency with the full search-parameter registry".
#
# It starts two things and then stays up:
#
#   1. A static "Data Provider" (python -m http.server) serving a Bulk Export
#      Manifest and one .ndjson with 2 Patients.
#   2. HFS with HFS_BULK_SUBMIT_FILE_CONCURRENCY=8, a value SQLite cannot
#      honour, so the fix forces the effective fan-out down to 1 and warns.
#
# It kills no processes and frees no ports: it picks free ports >18000 and runs
# both servers under `timeout`, so they shut themselves down when the TTL runs
# out.
#
# Requirements: cargo, curl and python on PATH. On Windows the interpreter must
# be invoked as `python`: `python3` resolves to the Microsoft Store stub, which
# prints a notice and exits without starting anything.

# is not even installed), and when the pattern does not match every port would
# look free, so the failure would only show up much later, at server startup.
# connect() runs FIRST because bind() alone is not a valid liveness test on
# Windows: there SO_REUSEADDR permits binding a port that is actively
# LISTENING, so a bind-only check reports every port free and the script
# happily attaches to somebody else's server. SO_REUSEADDR is still used for
# the bind half, where it does the job it was added for: keeping a socket in
