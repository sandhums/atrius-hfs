//! Process-global dashboard data provider.
//!
//! The web UI's landing dashboard renders a "FHIR resources over time" chart and
//! a few headline totals. Those figures come from the storage backend, which
//! lives behind `helios-rest`'s `AppState` — a layer this crate deliberately does
//! not depend on. To keep `helios-observability` storage-agnostic (and the UI
//! crate thin), the server registers a [`DashboardProvider`] here at startup, and
//! the UI reads the latest snapshot through [`snapshot`] without knowing anything
//! about persistence.
//!
//! This mirrors the process-global pattern already used by [`crate::uptime`] and
//! [`crate::metrics`]: install once at startup, read cheaply per request.
//!
//! ## Scope and trust
//!
//! The registered provider reports counts for a **single tenant** (the server's
//! default tenant) and is consumed only by the operator dashboard. Per-tenant
//! counts are deliberately never exported to the public Prometheus `/metrics`
//! endpoint (see [`crate::metrics`]); this snapshot is a separate, operator-facing
//! surface.
//!
//! ## Time resolution
//!
//! The chart is sampled over a [`DashboardWindow`], which pairs a span with the
//! bucket width used to sample it (1h/1min, 24h/30min, 30d/1day). Span and bucket
//! are coupled rather than independent, and the underlying series is built from
//! the immutable history log — see [`DashboardWindow`] for why both of those
//! matter.
