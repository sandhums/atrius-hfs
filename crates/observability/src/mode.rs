//! Observability arm selection (`HELIOS_OBS_MODE`).
//!
//! Per-request instrumentation is not free, and on a terminology server
//! answering tens of thousands of requests per second it is measurable against
//! the handler work itself. This module exists so that cost can be *attributed*
//! rather than argued about: run the same commit twice on the same host with
//! only `HELIOS_OBS_MODE` varying, and the throughput delta is the price of the
//! component that changed.
//!
//! It is a diagnostic knob, not a tuning knob. [`ObsMode::Default`] is what
//! production ships and what the benchmark measures unless told otherwise; the
//! other arms deliberately misconfigure the server to isolate a cost, and
//! [`ObsMode::Full`] exists to reproduce a historical (pre-fix) profile for
//! comparison. Reaching for a non-default arm to make a number look better
//! would be measuring a server nobody runs.
