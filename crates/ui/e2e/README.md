# helios-ui browser tests (Playwright + axe-core)

The outer ring of the UI test pyramid (issue #249): behavior only a real browser
can observe — WCAG 2.2 AA conformance, `theme.js` before first paint, the
`/_user/settings` merge-patch, progressive enhancement with JS off, and the
no-CDN invariants. The fast inner ring stays in Rust (`crates/ui/tests/*.rs`,
`tower::oneshot`).

Everything Node lives here; the cargo workspace is untouched.

## Layout

Specs live in `tests/`; the **Page Object Model** lives in `pages/` — one class
per page/component, wired onto Playwright's `test` via `pages/fixtures.ts`. Specs
import `{ test, expect }` from `../pages/fixtures` and receive page objects as
fixtures (`async ({ resources, history }) => …`); `pages/api.ts` seeds resources
over the REST API for state-dependent tests.

Most projects share one server and one user (`l2:`, the default when auth is
disabled) across every test. The server-side rail state introduced by
#754/#755 — "recently used" + "last selected" per page, stored in `rails`
under `/_user/settings` — is therefore per-*user*, not per-test: without a
reset, a selection recorded by one test would still be there for the next one
to restore from. `pages/fixtures.ts`'s `page` fixture resets `rails` (a merge
patch of `{"rails": null}`) before every test runs. Nothing else under
`/_user/settings` is touched by the reset.

The reset is **100% best-effort** and never fails a test over its own result:
the whole request is wrapped in `try`/`catch`, and no response status is
checked at all. This matters beyond the plain SQLite leg — the `auth` and
`auth-degraded` projects run against `HFS_AUTH`-enabled servers and this
fixture carries no bearer token, so the reset there always comes back
401/403; other legs can 501 (no settings store configured) or fail to connect
outright. All of that is silently swallowed; only navigation failures a test
actually depends on should ever fail it.

| Path | What it covers |
|------|----------------|
| `tests/a11y.spec.ts` | axe-core WCAG 2.2 AA over every full page, light × dark, plus three targeted states on the ViewDefinition editor (#821): the completion popup, the lint hover tooltip, and the lint panel, each open, in both themes |
| `tests/no-cdn.spec.ts` | no off-origin requests, no page errors, no inline `<script>` — every page, plus a whole ViewDefinition editing session (#821: an edit that fires the lint's server round trip, then a completion popup) |
| `tests/theme.spec.ts` | FOUC guard, OS-preference precedence, PATCH merge-patch, server-roam, graceful degradation |
| `tests/chrome.spec.ts` | the collapsible nav: toggle, aria sync, localStorage cache, `/_user/settings` roam |
| `tests/dashboard.spec.ts` | stat cards, chart, time-window + legend link controls |
| `tests/resources.spec.ts` | type rail (filter + live counts), **every resource type is reachable**, modal open/close, delete |
| `tests/resources-editor.spec.ts` | edit flows: Create targets the picked type, inline binding validation, Save blocked on invalid, raw-edit round-trips |
| `tests/editor-controls.spec.ts` | fold/expand, add-node (+filter), remove, `value[x]` choice, ad-hoc extension, standalone `/ui/editor` |
| `tests/history.spec.ts` | version rail, from/to selects, the **show-metadata diff checkbox**, deep-link, not-found |
| `tests/compartments.spec.ts` | rail + tabs, the membership tester's four outcomes (member/self/not-member/fan-out), and the stored `last` restore through the nav |
| `tests/queries.spec.ts` | query builder: run → results, pagination, add-condition, per-type param datalist, Recent |
| `tests/nl-search.spec.ts` | NL mode toggle; translation lands a query and never runs it; refusal; example chips (stubbed `/$nl-search`) |
| `tests/search-parameters.spec.ts` | registry table, htmx rail filter, facet narrowing, row → detail |
| `tests/tenants.spec.ts` | add-tenant slide-over, htmx search filter, delete (skips if no tenant store) |
| `tests/sql-view-definitions.spec.ts` | View Definitions playground: rail, live `$sql-run` preview (#752); the guided-form card beside the editor (#843) — add a column from the form, edit `resource` in CodeMirror and see the row (and an invalid value's error) sync back, Ctrl+Z after a form edit, the two cards' shared internally-scrolling height, and the row↔editor cross-highlight in both directions (hover a row, click a JSON line, reveal stays inside each pane's own scroll) |
| `tests/vd-editor-lint.spec.ts` | the ViewDefinition editor's lint UI (#821): gutter marker + underline for an unknown key, the hover tooltip's message and fix buttons, applying a fix by click, Ctrl+. (one action applies directly, several open the lint panel), a duplicate column name's `_2` fix, an extra iteration directive's remove fix leaving valid JSON, an undeclared constant underlined at exactly its own `%name` token, Ctrl+Z undoing a fix in one step, the save-with-errors confirmation (cancel/accept, never for a valid document or for Duplicate), and `?lang=es` rendering |
| `tests/vd-editor-completion.spec.ts` | the ViewDefinition editor's completion popup (#821): structural keys inside `column[]` (offered, excluded-if-present, required marker), skeleton insertion with valid surrounding commas and the cursor left inside the value, FHIRPath elements after a dot, the ancestor `select`'s own `forEach` context, `%` for constants/environment variables, a function candidate's call insertion, no popup/request outside a completion context, Ctrl+Space opening it with nothing typed, and the required marker's `?lang=es` translation |
| `tests/sql-libraries.spec.ts` | SQL Queries/SQL Views playgrounds (#839): rail split by kind, SQL pane decode/highlight/roundtrip, the live `$sql-run` preview, recents, and a parse error's tinted line — plus, since #840, the Details section's own `describe`: a guided-form edit lands in the JSON pane and Save persists the merge, an invalid value errors on its row without saving, Save fuses an edited SQL pane with an edited Details title into one Library, Ctrl+Z after a form edit, the two Details cards' shared internally-scrolling height, and the type-code Save gate (`sql-view` saved from SQL Queries, and the reverse) on both routes; and, since #841, the Parameters card's own `describe`: an undeclared `:fam` placeholder shows a hint with a *Declare* button, declaring it writes `Library.parameter` into the (unsaved) Details JSON and reveals a form-associated value field, filling it runs the query and clears the "waiting" notice, clearing it waits again while the last successful table stays on screen, and Ctrl+Z in Details undoes the declaration as one step; and, since #842,
the Tables panel's own `describe`: on a SQL View, *Add table* searches and
selects a ViewDefinition, autofills the Alias from the option's own name,
*Add* resolves and renders the row (with a link to the ViewDefinition's own
page) and carries the dependency into the (unsaved) JSON pane, *Used by*
lists the SQL Query created in the test as depending on it, and *Remove*
clears the row and the JSON entry again (removing the *only* declaration a
still-referenced SQL reads turns it into its own unknown-table row instead
of emptying the card, #842/04) — none of it ever saved; and, since #842/04,
the "Unknown-table lint and Columns" `describe`: typing an undeclared table
name lints live (notice, tinted line, `@codemirror/lint` underline with a
hover tooltip, a gutter marker, a red *Reads from* row) with the previous
table and Columns card left on screen under a "last successful run" meta,
*Declare* opens *Add table* pre-filled with that exact name, and resolving
it through the combobox clears the lint, refreshes the table, and fills
Columns with the newly declared label's own origin |
| `tests/editor-pair.spec.ts` | The shared editor/guided-form host (`assets/editor-pair.js`, #840) — coverage of the pairing's own contract that is not tied to one page: the invalid-JSON chip still switches after a guided-form round trip has replaced the `.editor-form` card underneath it |
| `tests/nojs/*.spec.ts` | the README promise: the UI works with JavaScript disabled (`nojs` project) — includes `sql-view-definitions.spec.ts`'s and `sql-libraries.spec.ts`'s own cases: the guided-form card (#843/#840) stays hidden and both editors work alone; (#821) a ViewDefinition with lint errors still saves through Save with no dialog and no `.cm-editor` on the page at all; for `sql-libraries.spec.ts`, editing both the Details and SQL textareas by hand and saving persists the merged Library, (#841) the Parameters card's native `<details>` disclosure plus a plain `formaction` submit adds a declaration and re-renders the page around it, with the saved page then showing the "waiting" notice for the still-unfilled value, (#842) the Tables panel's own fallback textarea (`data-combobox-fallback`) takes a hand-typed `ViewDefinition/{id}` reference — *Add table* re-renders the page around the resolved row and Save persists the `depends-on` entry, and (#842/04) saving a SQL that reads an undeclared table shows the same lint notice and red row on `?…&saved=1`'s own server-rendered page, with *Add table* already open and its alias pre-filled — the only way a no-JS visitor can reach it |

Pure-function browser modules (`assets/combobox.js`; `assets/editor-pair.js`'s
`minimalChange`; `assets/vd-editor.js`'s completion/diagnostic-fix helpers
(#821) — `skeletonForDetail`, `classifyObjectGap`, `buildKeyInsertion`,
`codePointOffset`/`utf16OffsetForCodePoints`, `stringContentRange`,
`escapeJsonStringContent`, `removeKeyRange`; the vendored bundle's own export
surface and size budget) get a third, faster ring: plain Node tests under
`unit/` (`editor-pair.test.cjs`, `vd-editor.test.cjs`,
`codemirror-bundle.test.cjs`), run with `npm run test:unit` — no browser, no
server. `editor-pair.js` and `vd-editor.js` are wired UMD-style
(`module.exports` under Node; `window.HfsEditorPair` / auto-mount under a
real `document`) specifically so this stays possible without a second copy
of the diff algorithm or the completion helpers.

## Run it

```bash
# 1. Build the server once (the suite boots it via boot.mjs).
cargo build -p helios-hfs --features ui

# 2. Install deps + a browser (first time only).
cd crates/ui/e2e
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium

# 3. Run.
npx playwright test              # all projects
npx playwright test theme        # one spec
npx playwright test --ui         # watch mode
npx playwright show-report       # last HTML report
```

`boot.mjs` starts the most recently built `target/{release,debug}/hfs` on
`127.0.0.1:8080` with a throwaway SQLite DB, and Playwright tears it down.
Locally the suite reuses a server you already have up on that port; set `CI=1`
to force a fresh boot.

The axe gate is strict: **every** WCAG 2.2 AA rule (including `color-contrast`,
in both themes) is a hard failure.

## Driving an external server

Set `HFS_E2E_BASE_URL` to point the suite at an hfs you started yourself; the
config then skips `boot.mjs` and drives that server instead:

```bash
HFS_E2E_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080 npx playwright test
```

This is how the backend matrix runs it: `ui-tests-matrix.yml` builds hfs with
every storage backend, boots it on the runner host against a containerized
Postgres / Mongo / Elasticsearch / S3, and runs this suite (in the Playwright
container) against `http://<runner-ip>:<port>`. The per-PR `ui-tests.yml` stays
on SQLite for fast feedback; the matrix is manual + nightly.
