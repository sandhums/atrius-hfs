# helios-ui browser tests (Playwright + axe-core)

The outer ring of the UI test pyramid (issue #249): behavior only a real browser
can observe — WCAG 2.2 AA conformance, `theme.js` before first paint, the
`/_user/settings` merge-patch, progressive enhancement with JS off, and the
no-CDN invariants. The fast inner ring stays in Rust (`crates/ui/tests/*.rs`,
`tower::oneshot`).

Everything Node lives here; the cargo workspace is untouched.

## Layout

Specs live in `tests/`; the **Page Object Model** lives in `pages/` — one class
per page/component, wired onto Playwright's `test` via `pages/fixtures.ts`. Specs
import `{ test, expect }` from `../pages/fixtures` and receive page objects as
fixtures (`async ({ resources, history }) => …`); `pages/api.ts` seeds resources
over the REST API for state-dependent tests.

| Path | What it covers |
|------|----------------|
| `tests/a11y.spec.ts` | axe-core WCAG 2.2 AA over every full page, light × dark |
| `tests/no-cdn.spec.ts` | no off-origin requests, no page errors, no inline `<script>` — every page |
| `tests/theme.spec.ts` | FOUC guard, OS-preference precedence, PATCH merge-patch, server-roam, graceful degradation |
| `tests/chrome.spec.ts` | the collapsible nav: toggle, aria sync, localStorage cache, `/_user/settings` roam |
| `tests/dashboard.spec.ts` | stat cards, chart, time-window + legend link controls |
| `tests/resources.spec.ts` | type rail (filter + live counts), **every resource type is reachable**, modal open/close, delete |
| `tests/resources-editor.spec.ts` | edit flows: Create targets the picked type, inline binding validation, Save blocked on invalid, raw-edit round-trips |
| `tests/editor-controls.spec.ts` | fold/expand, add-node (+filter), remove, `value[x]` choice, ad-hoc extension, standalone `/ui/editor` |
| `tests/history.spec.ts` | version rail, from/to selects, the **show-metadata diff checkbox**, deep-link, not-found |
| `tests/compartments.spec.ts` | rail + tabs, and the membership tester's four outcomes (member/self/not-member/fan-out) |
| `tests/queries.spec.ts` | query builder: run → results, pagination, add-condition, per-type param datalist, Recent |
| `tests/nl-search.spec.ts` | NL mode toggle; translation lands a query and never runs it; refusal; example chips (stubbed `/$nl-search`) |
| `tests/search-parameters.spec.ts` | registry table, htmx rail filter, facet narrowing, row → detail |
| `tests/tenants.spec.ts` | add-tenant slide-over, htmx search filter, delete (skips if no tenant store) |
| `tests/nojs/*.spec.ts` | the README promise: the UI works with JavaScript disabled (`nojs` project) |

## Run it

```bash
# 1. Build the server once (the suite boots it via boot.mjs).
cargo build -p helios-hfs --features ui

# 2. Install deps + a browser (first time only).
cd crates/ui/e2e
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium

# 3. Run.
npx playwright test              # all projects
npx playwright test theme        # one spec
npx playwright test --ui         # watch mode
npx playwright show-report       # last HTML report
```

`boot.mjs` starts the most recently built `target/{release,debug}/hfs` on
`127.0.0.1:8080` with a throwaway SQLite DB, and Playwright tears it down.
Locally the suite reuses a server you already have up on that port; set `CI=1`
to force a fresh boot.

The axe gate is strict: **every** WCAG 2.2 AA rule (including `color-contrast`,
in both themes) is a hard failure.

## Driving an external server

Set `HFS_E2E_BASE_URL` to point the suite at an hfs you started yourself; the
config then skips `boot.mjs` and drives that server instead:

```bash
HFS_E2E_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080 npx playwright test
```

This is how the backend matrix runs it: `ui-tests-matrix.yml` builds hfs with
every storage backend, boots it on the runner host against a containerized
Postgres / Mongo / Elasticsearch / S3, and runs this suite (in the Playwright
container) against `http://<runner-ip>:<port>`. The per-PR `ui-tests.yml` stays
on SQLite for fast feedback; the matrix is manual + nightly.
