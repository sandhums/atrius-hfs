//! Schema-driven resource editor (#264).
//!
//! The design in `docs/resource-editor-design.md`, made real. Two things about
//! it are unusual and both are deliberate.
//!
//! **The document is the state.** There is no client-side model and no session
//! on the server. Every structural mutation — add a node, remove one, pick a
//! `value[x]` type, attach an extension — posts the whole in-flight resource
//! back, the server applies the mutation, re-validates, re-renders, and htmx
//! swaps the result in. Resources are small and `validate_sync` is a pure
//! ~300 µs call, so this is affordable, and it buys three things a form
//! projection cannot: the editor's hard rules (cardinality, choice groups,
//! slicing) exist once, in Rust, where they are tested; validation errors
//! arrive already anchored to their node; and **whatever we do not render, we
//! also do not destroy** — the `_birthDate` sibling of an extended primitive
//! survives a round-trip here, and does not survive one in any editor surveyed
//! for #264.
//!
//! **Extensions are ordinary elements.** They are not a panel and not an escape
//! hatch. `extension` is an element of `HumanName` exactly as `family` is, so it
//! is offered wherever the schema allows it, at any depth, nested, with the
//! full `value[x]` type pick — which is the thing none of the surveyed editors
//! can do on a resource that carries no profile.
