//! Shared chrome markup for the two Helios web UIs.
//!
//! # Why this crate exists
//!
//! HFS (`crates/ui`) and HTS (`crates/hts-ui`) present one product to an
//! operator, so their topbar has to look and behave the same. Until now that
//! was maintained by copying markup between the two template trees and hoping.
//! It did not hold:
//!
//! * `crates/hts-ui/templates/layouts/base.html` carried a comment asserting
//!   the account menu was byte-for-byte the HFS block. That assertion silently
//!   stopped being true.
//! * A `.lang-switcher` control survived in the HTS copy after HFS had deleted
//!   both the control and its CSS rule — HTS was rendering markup that nothing
//!   styled any more.
//! * `crates/hts-ui/tests/chrome_parity.rs` grew to 517 lines whose entire job
//!   is to notice that kind of drift *after* it has been committed.
//!
//! A test that detects divergence is strictly worse than a structure that
//! cannot diverge. So the markup lives here, once, and both crates render it
//! through [`user_menu`]. There is no second copy to fall out of step with.
//!
//! # What is shared, and how
//!
//! The template is [`templates/partials/user-menu.html`][partial] plus the two
//! icons it includes. `{% include "icons/..." %}` resolves against *this*
//! crate's `templates/` root, because the `#[derive(Template)]` that owns the
//! partial lives in this crate — a consumer needs no icon files of its own.
//!
//! [partial]: https://github.com/HeliosSoftware/hfs/blob/main/crates/ui-chrome/templates/partials/user-menu.html
//!
//! The partial is a byte-verbatim extract of what used to be
//! `crates/ui/templates/layouts/base.html:233-267`, so moving it changed no
//! HFS page byte. Preserving that is a hard requirement, and it is what the
//! trailing whitespace-suppression sentinel in the partial is for: the caller
//! supplies the newline after `</details>`, so the render must not end with
//! one. See `tests/user_menu.rs::renders_without_a_trailing_newline`.
//!
//! [`capability`] shares more than markup: the CapabilityStatement projection
//! itself lives there, because HFS and HTS were each parsing the same document
//! into their own `CapabilityView` and each fixing the result separately.
//!
//! # What is deliberately *not* shared here
//!
//! CSS. `crates/ui/assets/app.css` is already shared byte-for-byte by
//! `crates/hts-ui/src/lib.rs` embedding `../ui/assets` directly, and lifting
//! it into a neutral crate is gated on #543. The same goes for
//! `json-view.js`, which drives the folding for both products from that embed.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use helios_ui_chrome::{ChromeLabels, UserIdentity, user_menu};
//!
//! struct Labels;
//! impl ChromeLabels for Labels {
//!     fn lang(&self) -> String {
//!         "en".to_string()
//!     }
//!     fn t(&self, key: &str) -> String {
//!         // a real consumer routes this into its fluent bundle
//!         key.to_string()
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let html = user_menu(&Labels, UserIdentity::default())?;
//! # Ok::<(), askama::Error>(())
//! ```
//!
//! The rendered fragment is normally handed to the consuming layout as a
//! pre-escaped string, e.g. `{{ user_menu|safe }}` — see the note on
//! [`user_menu`] about why that is sound.
