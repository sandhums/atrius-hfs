//! Executing fixed-text SQL through the connection's prepared-statement cache.
//!
//! `tokio_postgres::Client::execute("SQL…", …)` looks like it sends one message.
//! It does not. `&str` implements `ToStatement` as `ToStatementType::Query`,
//! which calls `client.prepare(sql)` first — so every call is Parse + Describe +
//! Sync (one round trip, and a full raw parse, parse analysis and plan on the
//! server) followed by Bind + Execute + Sync (a second round trip). The
//! statement is then dropped and closed again.
//!
//! On the benchmark's Postgres — 4 CPUs, shared — that parse work is charged to
//! the same four cores the inserts need, and `pg_stat_statements` does not even
//! show it: `total_exec_time` excludes parsing and (with `track_planning` off,
//! the default) planning. So the measured 8,384 s of import execution time and
//! 6,882 s of crud execution time are the cost *after* every one of those
//! statements had been parsed from scratch — 3.2M times for import, 7.6M for
//! crud.
//!
//! `deadpool_postgres::Client::prepare_cached` keeps the `Statement` in a
//! per-connection cache, so the second and later executions of the same SQL text
//! send Bind + Execute + Sync only. Postgres re-uses the parse tree, and after
//! five executions promotes it to a generic plan and stops planning too.
//!
//! Two rules make this safe to use here:
//!
//! 1. **Only fixed SQL text.** The cache is unbounded and keyed by the query
//!    string, so a `format!`-built statement (everything the search query
//!    builder emits) would grow it without limit, on every connection, and leak
//!    server-side prepared statements with it. Every call site below passes a
//!    string literal or a `LazyLock`-built constant.
//! 2. **Only where a generic plan is the plan anyway.** These are primary-key
//!    lookups, single-table deletes by their index prefix, and inserts — none of
//!    them has a parameter-dependent plan choice for a generic plan to get
//!    wrong.
//!
//! Named prepared statements live for the session (protocol docs: "Named
//! prepared statements … last until explicitly destroyed or the session ends"),
//! not for the transaction, so one created inside a bundle transaction survives
//! its rollback. The pool is also configured with deadpool's default
//! `RecyclingMethod::Fast`, which runs no recycling query — nothing issues
//! `DEALLOCATE ALL` or `DISCARD ALL` behind the cache's back.
//!
//! # The read path, and why rule 1 and rule 2 both had to be relaxed
//!
//! The two rules above kept the search path out of the cache entirely, so every
//! one of the search suite's 363,660 calls in a five-minute window still paid a
//! full Parse + Describe + Sync round trip and a fresh raw parse and parse
//! analysis on the server. `search_impl.rs` now uses [`query_dyn_cached`] /
//! [`query_one_dyn_cached`], which relax both rules under a specific
//! justification rather than by exception:
//!
//! **Rule 1 (fixed text) becomes a measured ceiling.** The query builder's
//! output is not one string, but it is not arbitrary either: what varies is the
//! predicate shape, the inlined `param_name` (bounded by the SearchParameter
//! registry), and the inlined `LIMIT` (`_count` is clamped to 1000 by
//! `extractors::pagination`). What is *genuinely* unbounded stays off the cached
//! path by construction — see `search_impl.rs` for the three call sites left on
//! `client.query(&str, …)` and why. Everything else is bounded by
//! `DEFAULT_STATEMENT_CACHE_MAX`.
//!
//! **Rule 2 (generic plan is the plan anyway) becomes false for search, so the
//! generic plan is taken away.** Caching a statement makes it persistent, and a
//! persistent statement is promoted to a generic plan after five executions.
//! Measured against a 21.8M-row `search_index` built to the benchmark's
//! proportions, `plan_cache_mode = force_generic_plan` versus
//! `force_custom_plan`, total buffers touched to answer the same page:
//!
//! | shape                                     | custom | generic | ratio |
//! |-------------------------------------------|--------|---------|-------|
//! | `Observation?patient=Patient/x`           |  1,499 | 6,005,788 | 4,006x |
//! | `Observation?patient:below=Patient/x`     |  1,469 | 6,005,788 | 4,088x |
//! | `Observation?category=laboratory,vitals`  |    464 | 2,453,618 | 5,288x |
//! | `Observation?code:text=…`                 | 2.2M   |    17.2M  |   7.7x |
//! | `Observation?code=sys|code` (join form)   | 69,736 |   601,668 |   8.6x |
//! | `Patient?address=Spring` (v34 range)      |  1,504 |     1,493 |   1.0x |
//! | token `=`, quantity, uri, date, `_id`, PK |   —    |     —     |   1.0x |
//!
//! The reference rows are the `value_reference = $3 OR value_reference LIKE $4
//! ESCAPE '\\'` form: under a custom plan the planner sees the pattern as a
//! `Const` and extracts prefix bounds for `idx_search_reference_pattern`; under
//! a generic plan the pattern is a `Param`, no bounds exist, and the scan reads
//! the whole `(tenant, type, param_name)` slice. This is the same defect seat J
//! removed from the string path in v34, on a predicate that still has it. The
//! OR-list row is a different mechanism with the same outcome: an `OR` of two
//! equalities cannot be an index condition either way, and only the custom plan
//! estimates it well enough to pick the `…_recent` index whose ordering lets the
//! `LIMIT` terminate early.
//!
//! End to end through this driver and pool, 8 concurrent clients, a ten-shape
//! search mix, five paired rounds on the same database (medians):
//!
//! | arm                                    | qps   | p50    |
//! |----------------------------------------|-------|--------|
//! | `client.query(&str, …)` (before)       | 6,616 |  959us |
//! | `prepare_cached`, `plan_cache_mode=auto` | *see below* | |
//! | `prepare_cached`, `force_custom_plan`  | 7,782 |  771us |
//!
//! +17.6% throughput, -19.6% p50. On the two generic-unsafe shapes alone,
//! measured separately because it does not belong in an average: 6,349 qps
//! before, **56.8 qps** with `prepare_cached` and the default `auto`, 7,626 qps
//! with `force_custom_plan`. A 112x collapse is what shipping the naive change
//! would have done to `Observation?patient=…`.
//!
//! So the pool ships `plan_cache_mode = force_custom_plan` in the startup packet
//! (`backend.rs`). Every plan stays byte-identical to the one this backend
//! produces today — today's throwaway statement is planned once, with its
//! parameter values in hand, which is a custom plan — and what the cache removes
//! is the parse, the parse analysis, the Describe and one of the two round
//! trips. Planning is still paid per execution. That is the conservative half of
//! the available win, deliberately: the other half needs the reference predicate
//! made sargable-under-generic (the same treatment v34 gave the string
//! predicate) before `auto` is safe to switch on.
