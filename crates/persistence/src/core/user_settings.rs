//! Per-user UI settings storage.
//!
//! This module defines [`SettingsStore`], a small storage abstraction for an
//! opaque, per-user JSON settings document. It is deliberately *separate* from
//! the FHIR [`ResourceStorage`](crate::core::ResourceStorage) hierarchy: UI
//! preferences such as theme, default tenant, active FHIR version, or recent
//! queries are private user state, not FHIR resources, and should not surface
//! in `CapabilityStatement`, `_history`, `_search`, or `$export`.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! - **One document per user.** Each user owns a single JSON *object* keyed by a
//!   caller-supplied `user_key` (e.g. `"u2:{issuer_len}:{issuer}:{subject}"`
//!   from an authenticated principal, or a fixed local key when auth is
//!   disabled). The key is opaque to this layer; deriving it injectively is the
//!   caller's job — see `helios_rest::extractors::UserKey`.
//! - **Opaque and extensible.** The document is stored as an arbitrary
//!   [`serde_json::Value`] object, so new settings keys require no schema or
//!   code changes — the frontend owns the document shape.
//! - **Keyed by user, scoped by tenant *inside* the document.** The document is
//!   keyed by user only — a preference like "default tenant" is inherently
//!   cross-tenant, and the key must stay tenant-free for it to roam. But most of
//!   what a client stores is *derived from one tenant's data*: a saved FHIR query
//!   such as `Patient?name=smith&birthdate=1970-01-01` is a PHI-bearing string
//!   belonging to the tenant it was written against. Those keys therefore live
//!   under a reserved [`BY_TENANT_KEY`] map so a tenant purge can reach them.
//!   See [the scoping section](#tenant-scoping-within-the-document).
//! - **Optimistically lockable.** Each document carries a monotonic `version`
//!   that increments on every write and is surfaced to clients as a weak ETag
//!   (`W/"{version}"`). Callers may pass `if_match_version` to make a write
//!   conditional and avoid lost updates.
//!
//! # Tenant scoping within the document
//!
//! The **wire format is flat** and unchanged: a client `GET`s, `PUT`s and
//! `PATCH`es a plain object with `theme`, `savedQueries`, … at the top level. The
//! REST layer projects and scopes on the way through, so no client — including
//! ones this project does not ship — has to know about the layout below.
//!
//! The **stored format** separates the two lifetimes:
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "theme": "dark",              // user-global: roams across tenants
//!   "fhirVersion": "R4",          // user-global
//!   "byTenant": {
//!     "acme": { "savedQueries": { "Patient": { … } }, "recentSearches": [ … ] },
//!     "beta": { "savedQueries": { … } }
//!   }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! [`GLOBAL_SETTINGS_KEYS`] is the *complete* list of top-level keys that stay
//! user-global — deliberately a denylist rather than an allowlist of scoped keys.
//! A client key the server has never heard of is scoped by default, so a future
//! key holding PHI-derived content is covered without anyone remembering to add
//! it here. The cost of getting it wrong in this direction is that a preference
//! resets once per tenant; the cost in the other direction is unreachable PHI,
//! which is the whole point of this design (issue #313).
//!
//! ## Documents written before scoping existed
//!
//! A pre-#313 document has its scoped keys at the top level with no
//! [`BY_TENANT_KEY`] map. Such a document is *attributed* to its `tenantId` key
//! (the tenant the UI was pointed at, and therefore the tenant those queries were
//! written against) when that names a tenant, and is otherwise **unattributed**.
//!
//! - [`project_for_tenant`] shows a legacy document's scoped keys to its
//!   attributed tenant, or — when unattributed — to every tenant, exactly
//!   reproducing the pre-#313 user-global behaviour until the document is
//!   normalized. Reads never rewrite: `GET` stays side-effect-free.
//! - [`normalize_legacy`] runs on the first **write**, moving those keys under
//!   `byTenant.{attribution}`.
//! - [`purge_tenant_subtree`] removes an *unattributed* legacy document's scoped
//!   keys on **any** tenant purge. That is deliberate: unattributed PHI cannot be
//!   proven to belong to another tenant, and leaving it behind is the exact gap
//!   this design closes. A saved-query list is convenience state that a user can
//!   recreate; unreachable PHI is not. After the first purge the store is fully
//!   attributed and this branch stops firing.
//!
//! # Document conventions
//!
//! The document is schema-less, but keys shared between clients follow agreed
//! conventions. The established ones:
//!
//! - `theme` — `"light"` / `"dark"` (the web UI theme toggle).
//! - `savedQueries` — per-user saved FHIR queries, grouped by resource type
//!   and **keyed by query id** so a JSON merge patch can create, update, or
//!   delete a single entry without clobbering its siblings (RFC 7386 replaces
//!   arrays wholesale, hence objects, not arrays):
//!
//!   ```json
//!   {
//!     "savedQueries": {
//!       "Patient": {
//!         "01J8ZQ3F9V": {
//!           "name": "Smiths in Boston",
//!           "query": "name=smith&address-city=Boston",
//!           "createdAt": "2026-07-01T12:00:00Z",
//!           "lastAccessedAt": "2026-07-09T09:14:22Z",
//!           "accessCount": 12
//!         }
//!       }
//!     }
//!   }
//!   ```
//!
//!   Clients bump `lastAccessedAt` / `accessCount` with a merge patch when the
//!   query is run, and sort by `lastAccessedAt` descending, falling back to
//!   `createdAt` for never-run entries. The REST layer enforces structural
//!   bounds on this key (entries-per-type and whole-document size caps); see
//!   `helios-rest`'s user-settings handlers.
//!
//! - `recentSearches` — the search-builder's run history, newest first,
//!   deduped by query and capped by the client (currently 10):
//!
//!   ```json
//!   {
//!     "recentSearches": [
//!       { "query": "/Patient?name=smith", "at": "2026-07-11T09:14:22Z" }
//!     ]
//!   }
//!   ```
//!
//!   Unlike `savedQueries`, this is an array on purpose: it is a small
//!   bounded cache rewritten wholesale on every run, not sibling-keyed
//!   state, so RFC 7386's replace-the-array semantics are exactly right.
