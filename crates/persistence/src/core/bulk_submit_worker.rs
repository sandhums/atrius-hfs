//! Worker-facing traits for asynchronous Bulk Data **Submit** processing.
//!
//! The synchronous ingestion engine ([`BulkSubmitProvider`] and friends) does the
//! actual create/update/delete work. This module adds the missing async layer that
//! the FHIR Bulk Data Submit operation needs: a Data Consumer accepts a submission,
//! then a background worker **claims a pending manifest under a heartbeated,
//! fencing-token-guarded lease**, fetches the referenced files, and ingests them —
//! mirroring the bulk-export worker design ([`crate::core::bulk_export_worker`]).
//!
//! [`BulkSubmitProvider`]: crate::core::bulk_submit::BulkSubmitProvider

/// Renews a [`ManifestLease`] from a dedicated task for as long as it is alive.
///
/// The renewal must not share a future with the ingestion: a fast local stream
/// keeps the ingest future Ready-heavy enough that a sibling `select!` timer arm
/// is polled too rarely to ever fire, the lease silently expires mid-file, and
/// the manifest is reclaimed and restarted from its first file — an unbounded
/// loop, invisible in the counts because re-ingested entries upsert
/// idempotently. A separately spawned task renews on schedule no matter how the
/// ingest future behaves.
///
/// The keeper's task also flushes the shared byte progress every few seconds,
/// best-effort. On backends whose batch bookkeeping persists the counters
/// itself (SQLite) this is only a fallback — a standalone write can starve
/// for tens of seconds behind back-to-back batch transactions there, and the
/// value it finally lands is as old as the wait. All byte writes are
/// monotonic (`MAX`), so a stale flush can never walk progress backwards.
/// The heartbeat alone decides lease health.
///
/// A lease that cannot be renewed before it expires is fatal to the run that
/// holds it (#969). A heartbeat starved behind the ingest loop's writes used to
/// be retried indefinitely, so the manifest stayed claimable — eligible for
/// `claim_next_manifest` by a second worker — while this one kept committing
/// batches: silent duplicate ingestion on a cluster. Each renewal is now bounded
/// by what is left of the lease, and once `lease_expiry` passes unrenewed the
/// keeper declares the lease lost, which aborts the run mid-file.
///
/// On the same schedule the keeper re-reads the submission's status and trips
/// the ingest's [`CancelToken`] once it stops being ingestable (#968). The
/// keeper is the only part of a running job that touches the database on a
/// fixed schedule no matter what the ingest is doing, which makes it the one
/// place an abort can be noticed promptly; nothing else in the loop would look
