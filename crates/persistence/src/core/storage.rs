/// for persisting FHIR resources. All operations require a [`TenantContext`] to ensure
/// proper tenant isolation - there is no escape hatch.
///
/// # Tenant Isolation
///
/// Every operation takes a `TenantContext` as its first parameter. This design ensures
/// that tenant isolation is enforced at the type level - it's impossible to perform
/// storage operations without specifying the tenant context.
///
/// # Versioning
///
/// All mutating operations (create, update, delete) create new versions of resources.
/// The version ID is monotonically increasing and is used for optimistic locking via
/// the `If-Match` HTTP header.
///
/// # Soft Deletes
///
/// The `delete` operation performs a soft delete by default, marking the resource as
/// deleted but retaining its history. Use `purge` for permanent deletion (if supported).
