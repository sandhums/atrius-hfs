//! #1586: a transaction bundle that the server aborts with a
//! `TransientTransactionError` (`WriteConflict` and its kin) is re-run by the
//! backend instead of failing the whole request with a 400.
//!
//! Child module of the `mongodb_tests` root — `use super::*;` reaches its
//! private harness (`create_tenant`, `create_backend_with_app_name`,
//! `count_docs`, `transactions_required`, plus `Document`/`doc`/`json`/
//! `FhirVersion`, all imported at the test-crate root), the same arrangement as
//! `tests/mongodb/reindex_pipeline.rs`.
//!
//! Every test drives the server's `failCommand` failpoint, scoped to the
//! backend's `appName`, through a bundle of one Patient and one Observation that
//! references it by `urn:uuid`. `create_backend_with_app_name` forces
//! `retryWrites=false`; retryable writes do not apply inside a transaction, so
//! this only keeps the driver's own commit retry from muddying the counts.
