//! The backend failure contract.
//!
//! Every backend that implements [`ResourceStorage`] must fail *gracefully* when
//! its store is unreachable or misconfigured: it must surface a
//! `StorageError::Backend`, rather than panicking, hanging, or — worst of all —
//! returning a misleading success.
//!
//! The misleading-success case is the one that matters most, and it is why these
//! tests assert more than "an error came back". A `read` that reports `Ok(None)`
//! when it never actually reached the database is indistinguishable from a `read`
//! against a store where the resource genuinely is absent. For a FHIR server that
//! is not a cosmetic difference: "this patient has no recorded allergies" and "I
//! could not reach the database" are different clinical statements, and only one
//! of them is safe to act on. The same goes for `count` returning `Ok(0)`.
//!
//! So the contract is:
//!
//! > An operation against an unreachable or misconfigured store MUST return
//! > `Err(StorageError::Backend(_))`. It MUST NOT return `Ok(None)`, `Ok(0)`, or
//! > any other success, and it MUST NOT hang.
//!
//! Unlike the rest of the persistence suite these tests need **no server and no
//! Docker**: each backend is pointed at a dead address (or, for the embedded and
//! object stores, put into an equivalently broken state), so they always run — in
//! CI and locally.
//!
//! Backends differ in *where* the failure surfaces, and the tests below are shaped
//! accordingly rather than being copy-pasted:
//!
//! | Backend       | Construction | Failure surfaces at |
//! |---------------|--------------|---------------------|
//! | sqlite        | eager, sync  | construction (bad path) *and* operation (unmigrated schema) |
//! | postgres      | **eager**    | construction — `new()` verifies connectivity |
//! | mongodb       | lazy         | operation |
//! | elasticsearch | lazy         | operation |
//! | s3            | lazy or eager, per `validate_buckets_on_startup` | either |
//!
//! Adding a backend? Add a module here. A backend with no section in this file has
//! no evidence that it fails safely.

/// Shared contract helpers.
///
/// Deliberately inlined rather than placed in `tests/common/`: that directory is
/// not wired into any test target (no test file declares `mod common;`), so cargo
/// never compiles it. Reviving it would drag `harness`/`fixtures` and their
