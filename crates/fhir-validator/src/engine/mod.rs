//! The cooperative validation engine.
//!
//! Validation never flattens schemas: it builds a *set* of schemas (the
//! *schemata*) for every data node — root schema from `resourceType`,
//! profiles, plus every transitively referenced `base` and complex `type` —
//! and every member of the set judges the same node together. See
//! `docs/guide/mental-model.md` in the FHIR Schema repo for the model, and
//! `walk.rs` for the deterministic error-emission order.
