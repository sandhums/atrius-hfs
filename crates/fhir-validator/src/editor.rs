//! Editor projection: what a *user* may do at a point inside a resource.
//!
//! The engine answers "is this document legal?". An editor has to answer a
//! different question — *"here is a cursor; what am I allowed to put here?"* —
//! and that one has no document to check. It is a query against the schema
//! itself, and the engine's machinery for it ([`SchemaSet`](crate::engine)) is
//! private, so this module builds the answer from the public IR.
//!
//! It lives in this crate rather than in the web UI on purpose: the projection
//! is FHIR knowledge, not presentation, and the SearchParameter and Compartment
//! editors want the same thing.
//!
//! Three traps are handled here so no caller has to know about them:
//!
//! - **Choice groups occupy three keys.** `value[x]` appears in `elements` as a
//!   declarer (`value`, carrying `choices`) *plus* one concrete branch per type
//!   (`valueString`, each carrying `choice_of`). Offering the bare declarer as a
//!   field produces a document the engine rejects as an unknown element, so the
//!   declarer is offered as a **type pick** and the branches are suppressed.
//! - **Cardinality already spent is not tracked anywhere.** Nothing in the IR or
//!   the engine says "this element is 0..1 and already has a value". We diff the
//!   document against the schema to work it out.
//! - **Some pack schemas carry a literal `value[x]` element key** — a converter
//!   artifact. A caller enumerating keys would render a phantom field.
//!
//! Paths use the same dotted form the engine reports errors on
//! (`Patient.name.0.given`), so a [`ValidationError`](crate::ValidationError)
//! anchors onto an editor node by string equality — no FHIRPath parsing, and
//! none of the fuzzy path-matching that other editors resort to.
