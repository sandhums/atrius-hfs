# Authentication & Authorization

Use this when working in `helios-auth` or HFS auth behavior. The crate validates SMART-on-FHIR / OAuth2 JWT bearer tokens and enforces scopes. It is consumed by `helios-rest`, `helios-hfs`, and `helios-subscriptions`.

## Behavior

- Disabled by default. Set `HFS_AUTH_ENABLED=true` to require bearer tokens.
- Validates JWTs against a JWKS endpoint (`HFS_AUTH_JWKS_URL`), checking issuer, audience, and signing algorithm.
- Enforces SMART v2 scopes (e.g. `system/Patient.rs`) via `SmartScopePolicy` / `ScopeSet` / `SmartPermissions`.
- Derives the tenant from a JWT claim (`HFS_AUTH_TENANT_CLAIM`, default `tenant_id`).
- Serves `/.well-known/smart-configuration` (SMART discovery), populated from the `HFS_SMART_*` endpoints.
- Holds no cross-instance state: validation is local, so instances behind a load balancer need no shared infrastructure.

## Environment

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `HFS_AUTH_ENABLED` | `false` | Require bearer-token auth |
| `HFS_AUTH_JWKS_URL` | none | JWKS endpoint for token signature verification |
| `HFS_AUTH_ISSUER` | none | Expected `iss` |
| `HFS_AUTH_AUDIENCE` | none | Expected `aud` |
| `HFS_AUTH_ALGORITHMS` | `RS256,RS384,ES256,ES384` | Allowed signing algorithms |
| `HFS_AUTH_TENANT_CLAIM` | `tenant_id` | JWT claim used to resolve the tenant |
| `HFS_AUTH_JWKS_MIN_REFRESH_INTERVAL` | `10` | Minimum seconds between JWKS refreshes |

SMART discovery passthrough (advertised in `/.well-known/smart-configuration`): `HFS_SMART_TOKEN_ENDPOINT`, `HFS_SMART_AUTHORIZE_ENDPOINT`, `HFS_SMART_JWKS_URL`, `HFS_SMART_INTROSPECTION_ENDPOINT`, `HFS_SMART_MANAGEMENT_ENDPOINT`, `HFS_SMART_REGISTRATION_ENDPOINT`, `HFS_SMART_REVOCATION_ENDPOINT`. Outbound calls can carry `HFS_OUTBOUND_BEARER_TOKEN`.

## Token replay

There is **no `jti` replay cache** — bearer access tokens are accepted as many
times as the client presents them until they expire. Do not reintroduce one
(#205): single-use `jti` semantics belong to `private_key_jwt` client assertions
(RFC 7523 §3), which the authorization server's token endpoint enforces. HFS is
a resource server with no token endpoint, so every `jti` it sees belongs to a
*reusable* access token (Keycloak and most IdPs emit one on all of them), and
replay-checking it rejects the second and every later use of a perfectly valid
token.

A replay cache cannot defend a bearer token anyway: a replayed one is
byte-identical to a legitimate one. Real anti-replay needs sender-constrained
tokens (DPoP/mTLS), where a fresh per-request proof — not the access token — is
what gets checked. `crates/auth/tests/bearer_token_reuse.rs` pins this behavior.

## Key API

`AuthConfig`, `AuthProvider` / `JwksBearerAuthProvider`, `Principal`, `ScopeSet` / `SmartPermissions`, `SmartScopePolicy`, `JwksCache`, `SmartConfiguration`.

## Code map

`config.rs`, `provider/`, `jwks/` (cache, fetcher), `scope/` (smart_v2, permissions), `policy/`, `principal.rs`, `discovery.rs`, `outbound.rs`. Auth scopes are consumed by Bulk Data Submit (`system/bulk-submit`). Unit tests are inline in `src/`; integration tests live under `crates/auth/tests/`.

## Named operation scopes

Some operations are gated on a named scope of their own rather than on resource
permissions, via `ScopeSet::grants_operation(name)` — which matches a literal
`system/{name}` **or** any `system/*.<perm>` wildcard:

| Scope | Grants |
|---|---|
| `system/bulk-submit` | `$bulk-submit` ingestion |
| `system/purge` | `$purge` — permanent, irreversible deletion of a resource and its history |
| `system/reindex` | `$reindex` — rebuilding a tenant's entire search index |

These deliberately do **not** fall out of ordinary resource scopes: a token that
may soft-delete a Patient (`system/Patient.d`) must not thereby be able to
obliterate it, and a token that may write resources must not be able to rebuild
the search index.

The auth middleware's `extract_operation` returns `None` for `$purge`,
`$reindex`, and `$reindex-status` so their handlers can enforce the above — it
would otherwise classify `POST /Patient/$purge` as a *Create* on Patient. That
deferral list is a **narrow allowlist** (`HANDLER_AUTHORIZED_OPS` in
`crates/rest/src/middleware/auth.rs`), not a blanket rule for `$`-paths:
SQL-on-FHIR operations have no handler-level scope check, so exempting every
`$`-path from middleware classification would leave them entirely unauthorized.
