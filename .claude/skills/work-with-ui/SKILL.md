# HFS Web UI (`helios-ui`)

The crate is **`helios-ui` at `crates/ui`** — a thin Axum library crate mounted by
the `hfs` binary as a sub-router under `/ui`. It owns templates, static assets,
and view handlers. `crates/ui/README.md` is the long-form rationale; this skill
is the operational summary.

## Stack: server-rendered htmx, no SPA

There is **no React, Vue, Svelte, Alpine, or jQuery, and no bundler or build
step.** Do not introduce one.

| Layer | What we use |
|---|---|
| Templates | **Askama** — Jinja2-like, compiled and type-checked at build time, auto-escaping |
| Interactivity | **htmx 2.0.4**, vendored at `assets/htmx.min.js` |
| Client JS | Hand-written vanilla IIFEs in `assets/*.js` — no framework, no npm deps |
| Asset delivery | `rust-embed` + `axum-embed`, embedded into the binary; **never a runtime CDN** |
| Header handling | `axum-htmx` — `HxRequest` extractor, `AutoVaryLayer` (`Vary: HX-Request`) |
| i18n | `fluent-templates` over `locales/<locale>/main.ftl` at the **workspace root** |

Handlers return a **full page** on a hard navigation and an **HTML fragment** on
`HX-Request`. State lives on the server.

## Running

```bash
# The `ui` feature is on by default in helios-hfs.
cargo run -p helios-hfs            # then open http://127.0.0.1:8080/ui
cargo run -p helios-hfs --features ui

# Headless deployments: `headless` wins over `ui`.
cargo run -p helios-hfs --features headless
```

The mount is `#[cfg(all(feature = "ui", not(feature = "headless")))]` in
`crates/hfs/src/main.rs`. FHIR version features forward through
`helios-ui?/R4|R4B|R5|R6`, so the UI's viewers cover exactly the versions the
server was built with.

## Routes (`crates/ui/src/lib.rs`)

| Route | Method | Page |
|---|---|---|
| `/ui` | GET | Dashboard (stat cards + resources-over-time chart) |
| `/ui/resources` | GET | Resources workspace — type rail, search, edit modal |
| `/ui/editor` | GET | Standalone schema-driven resource editor |
| `/ui/editor/render` | POST | Applies every structural mutation and re-renders; the document rides with the request |
| `/ui/editor/expand` | GET | ValueSet expansion proxy to `HFS_TERMINOLOGY_SERVER` |
| `/ui/queries` | GET | Saved queries + visual search builder |
| `/ui/queries/params` | GET | Per-type search-parameter catalog (datalist) |
| `/ui/search` | GET | Natural-language search — **only registered when NL search is enabled** |
| `/ui/search-parameters` | GET | SearchParameter viewer/CRUD |
| `/ui/compartments` | GET | Compartment viewer + membership tester |
| `/ui/history` | GET | Version rail |
| `/ui/history/diff` | POST | Server-side diff of two versions (see `docs/history-diff-rendering.md`) |
| `/ui/batch` | GET | Batch/Transaction workspace |
| `/ui/tenants` | GET/POST | Tenant maintenance; `/ui/tenants/rows` (GET), `/ui/tenants/{id}` (DELETE) |
| `/ui/status` | GET | Reference implementation of the fragment-vs-full-page pattern |
| `/ui/version` | POST | Persists the sidebar FHIR-version choice, redirects back |
| `/ui/tenant`, `/ui/tenant/options` | POST/GET | Tenant selector |
| `/ui/assets/*` | GET | Embedded htmx, CSS, JS, fonts, logo |

The router `fallback_service` is the FHIR app, so anything not under `/ui` falls
through to the normal REST surface.

## Layout

- `src/` — Axum handlers returning `impl IntoResponse`. **Thin:** parse request →
  call into `helios-rest` / `helios-persistence` / `helios-fhir-validator` →
  render a template. Modules: `lib.rs` (router, dashboard, search, prefs),
  `editor.rs`, `search_params.rs`, `compartments.rs`, `conformance.rs`,
  `history.rs`, `tenants.rs`, `json_view.rs`, `i18n.rs`.
- `templates/layouts/` — `base.html`, the document shell.
- `templates/pages/` — full documents, extend a layout.
- `templates/partials/` — htmx-swappable fragments, no `<html>` wrapper;
  `{% include %}`d into pages so the first render and the swap emit identical markup.
- `templates/icons/*.svg` — Figma exports, fills normalized to `currentColor`, inlined.
- `assets/` — `htmx.min.js` (pinned), `app.css`, `fonts/`, `logo.png`, and the
  per-page scripts: `theme.js`, `editor.js`, `resources.js`, `saved-queries.js`,
  `batch.js`, `history.js`, `nl-search.js`, `resource-filter.js`, `conformance-crud.js`.

`theme.js` loads **without `defer`**, before first paint, to avoid a FOUC; every
other script is `defer`.

## Rules of the road

Enforced by review, and three of them by `e2e/tests/no-cdn.spec.ts`:

- **No HTML in Rust** string literals or `format!`. All markup lives in templates.
- **No business/FHIR logic in templates.** Templates render data; they don't compute it.
- **No new browser-facing JSON API** to feed the UI — htmx consumes HTML fragments.
- **No inline `<script>` blobs.** Prefer `hx-*` attributes (Locality of Behaviour);
  where JS is genuinely needed, add a small pinned asset. Inert
  `type="application/json"` data carriers are the one allowed exception.
- **No off-origin requests.** No CDN, no remote font, no remote image. HFS may run
  air-gapped, and a runtime CDN is a supply-chain risk.
- **`helios-rest` stays UI-agnostic** — the UI depends on the workspace, never the reverse.
- **Don't couple templates to a single FHIR version** — go through the
  version-agnostic abstractions.
- Every htmx-backed control needs a real `<a href>` / `<form>` underneath so it
  works with JavaScript disabled.

To update htmx, replace `assets/htmx.min.js` with the new pinned release and note
the version bump in the commit message.

## Configuration

The UI reads no configuration of its own; `hfs` passes it in at `mount()`.

| Variable | Effect on the UI |
|---|---|
| `HFS_DATA_DIR` | Spec bundle behind the SearchParameter / CompartmentDefinition viewers |
| `HFS_TERMINOLOGY_SERVER` | Backs `/ui/editor/expand` (binding lookups in the editor) |
| `HFS_NL_SEARCH_ENABLED` | Registers `/ui/search` and the NL toggle |
| `HFS_NL_SEARCH_API_KEY` | Whether NL search is configured vs. showing its setup state |
| `HFS_NL_SEARCH_MODEL` | Shown in the setup state |
| `HFS_OUTBOUND_BEARER_TOKEN` | Credentials for the UI's self-call (below) |
| `HFS_DEFAULT_TENANT`, `HFS_DEFAULT_FHIR_VERSION` | Defaults for the sidebar selectors |

### Conformance data comes over HTTP, from the server itself

SearchParameter and CompartmentDefinition are **not vendored into the UI**. The
crate fetches them from the server's own FHIR API on the loopback address —
storage is the source of truth.

When auth is enabled this self-call needs a valid bearer via
`HFS_OUTBOUND_BEARER_TOKEN`; without one it is rejected and the conformance pages
degrade to a warning (`pages/compartments-degraded.html`, covered by
`e2e/tests/auth/degraded.spec.ts`). A short-lived auto-minted token is the
planned follow-up (`crates/auth/src/outbound.rs`).

### Per-user preferences

Theme, nav state, FHIR version, tenant, and saved/recent queries roam in the
`/_user/settings` document (weak `ETag`, JSON merge patch, `If-Match` on write).
Tenant-derived keys live under a reserved `byTenant` map so a tenant purge can
reach them — see `/run-hfs-server` for the full semantics.

### i18n

Negotiation order: `?lang=` → `hfs_lang` cookie → `Accept-Language` (RFC 4647
Lookup) → `en`. Locales are `en`, `es`, `de` at `locales/<locale>/main.ftl`
(repo root, embedded at compile time). A key missing from a translation falls back
to English. Tests enforce key-set parity across locales. See `docs/multi-language.md`.

## Testing

Two rings. Both must pass.

**Inner ring — Rust, fast** (`tower::oneshot` against the mounted router):

```bash
cargo test -p helios-ui
```

`tests/router_http.rs`, `tests/i18n_http.rs`, `tests/tenants_http.rs`, plus
`mod tests` in most `src/` modules. `tenants_http.rs` uses a real SQLite store
(test-only `sqlite` feature on `helios-persistence`).

**Outer ring — Playwright + axe-core** (`crates/ui/e2e/`, self-contained Node;
the cargo workspace is untouched):

```bash
cargo build -p helios-hfs --features ui   # boot.mjs runs the newest target/{release,debug}/hfs
cd crates/ui/e2e && npm ci && npx playwright install chromium
npx playwright test                        # all projects
npx playwright test theme                  # one spec
HFS_E2E_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080 npx playwright test   # drive a server you started
```

Specs live in `tests/`; the Page Object Model lives in `pages/`, wired onto
`test` via `pages/fixtures.ts` — specs import `{ test, expect }` from
`../pages/fixtures`. `pages/api.ts` seeds resources over the REST API.

The axe gate is strict: **every WCAG 2.2 AA rule, including `color-contrast`, in
both light and dark, is a hard failure.** The `nojs` project asserts the UI still
works with JavaScript disabled.

CI: `ui-tests.yml` per PR (SQLite, fast); `ui-tests-matrix.yml` manual + nightly
across every storage backend.

## Gotchas

- **Askama fails the build**, not the request — a template referencing a missing
  field is a compile error. That is the point; don't route around it.
- `rust-embed` has `debug-embed` on, so debug builds embed assets too. Editing a
  file under `assets/` or `templates/` needs a **rebuild** to take effect.
- Assets are served with `Cache-Control: no-cache` plus a content ETag: unchanged
  assets 304, rebuilt ones always re-fetch. Don't "fix" a stale asset with a
  cache-busting query string.
- `AutoVaryLayer` emits `Vary: HX-Request` so a cache never serves a fragment for
  a hard navigation. A new handler that reads `HX-Request` gets this for free by
  being on this router — don't hand-roll the header.
- `/ui/search` does not exist when NL search is disabled; a test that navigates
  there unconditionally will 404.
- The `headless` feature is checked as `not(feature = "headless")`, so enabling
  both `ui` and `headless` yields **no UI**.
