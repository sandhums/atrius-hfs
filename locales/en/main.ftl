# Helios FHIR Server — UI message catalog
# Locale: English (en) — SOURCE LOCALE. Every key defined here is the
# canonical set; other locales are expected to provide the same keys.
#
# Syntax: Project Fluent (https://projectfluent.org/). Terms (prefixed with
# `-`) are reusable snippets; messages (bare identifiers) are what the UI
# looks up. Placeables `{ $var }` are interpolated by the caller. Do NOT put
# markup or logic here — translations are data, the template renders them.

## SearchParameter viewer (#238)

sp-heading = Search parameters
sp-lede = Browse the parameters this server resolves searches against, filtered by base resource type. Spec parameters are read-only; tenant-scoped editing arrives once search parameters live in storage.
sp-version-label = FHIR version
sp-spec-missing = The full spec bundle (search-parameters-*.json) was not found in the data directory — only the minimal embedded fallback parameters are shown.
sp-rail-label = Resource filter
sp-rail-search = Filter types
sp-rail-recent = Recently used
sp-rail-types = Resource types
sp-rail-all = All types
sp-facet-type = Type

sp-facet-source-label = Filter by source

sp-field-target = Target types
sp-field-components = Components
sp-status-hint = The loader promotes the spec's draft status to active on load.
sp-note-conflict = Duplicate (base, code) within the same source as { $url } — the registry rejects this collision (DuplicateCode).
sp-note-overrides = Overrides { $url } on (base, code): a Stored definition outranks the spec parameter, so this one resolves searches. The registry logs a WARN naming both URLs.
sp-note-shadowed = Shadowed by { $url } on (base, code): a higher-precedence source resolves searches for this slot.
sp-note-empty-expression = Empty expression: the extractor indexes zero rows, so every search on this parameter silently returns empty.
sp-note-no-target = Reference parameter with no target types: chained search cannot resolve the referenced type.
sp-note-choice-type = Choice-type expression: the extractor rewrites ofType(T) / as T to the concrete element (for example valueQuantity) before evaluating against raw stored JSON.
sp-writes-pending = Creating, overriding, and deleting tenant parameters lands once search parameters are stored in the database (#235).

## Compartment viewer & tester (#237)

cmp-heading = Compartments
cmp-lede = The compartment definitions this server routes /{"{"}compartment{"}"}/{"{"}id{"}"}/{"{"}type{"}"} requests with, and a tester that answers: is this type in this compartment, via which parameters, and what search does the server run?
cmp-rail-label = Compartment definitions
cmp-rail-heading = Compartments
cmp-rail-note = Base definitions ship with the server (codegen'd from the FHIR spec). Editing them implies a tenant-scoped override layer — open question on the issue.

cmp-result-self = ✓ member — the compartment resource itself ({"{"}def{"}"})
cmp-result-self-note = The compartment instance is trivially in its own compartment; the route reads the resource directly.
cmp-result-notmember = ✕ { $type } is not a member of this compartment
cmp-result-notmember-note = The server returns 404 with an OperationOutcome for types that are not compartment members.
cmp-result-fanout = Fans out to { $count } member types
cmp-result-fanout-note = Excluded types are skipped, not failed — the fan-out drops non-member types rather than erroring.
queries-builder-heading = Search builder
queries-url-label = FHIR search URL
queries-url-placeholder = GET /Patient?name=smith&birthdate=ge1980-01-01
queries-builder-hint = Edit the GET URL directly or through the rows below — they stay in sync. Run executes the search here and records it under Recent; give it a name to keep it in the saved list.
queries-recent = Recent
queries-recent-heading = Recent searches
queries-recent-empty = No recent searches yet — Run one to record it here.

search-mode-nl = Natural language
search-mode-builder = Visual builder

search-nl-label = Describe the search
search-nl-placeholder = Describe what you're looking for — e.g. patients named Smith born after 1980
search-nl-hint = Your text and this server's search parameters go to the language model. Patient data never does. The query it writes is shown below for you to check and run.
search-nl-working = Translating…
search-nl-caveats = Worth knowing:
search-nl-unsupported = That isn't a search this server can run. Try describing the records you want to find.

search-nl-example-1 = Female patients over 65 with a diabetes diagnosis
search-nl-example-2 = Observations from the last 30 days, most recent first
search-nl-example-3 = Encounters at Boston General still in progress

search-setup-heading = Natural-language search is available
search-setup-body = Turn plain-language descriptions into FHIR search queries. It needs an API key for a language model — the server reads it from the environment, and it never reaches this page. Until one is set, use the visual builder below.
search-setup-key-placeholder = your API key
search-setup-disable = To remove the feature entirely — endpoint, page, and this notice — set HFS_NL_SEARCH_ENABLED=false.
search-setup-docs = Read the how-to

editor-confirm-delete = Delete this resource? This cannot be undone.
editor-invalid-json = That is not valid JSON, so it cannot be edited as a form. Your text is untouched.
editor-source-hint = Edit the source directly. Switching back to the guided form parses it.

editor-add = Add element
editor-add-filter = Filter elements
editor-add-another = add another
editor-pick-type = Pick a type…
editor-extension-url = Extension URL
editor-add-extension = Add extension

editor-valid = No issues.
editor-issues = { $count ->
    [one] { $count } issue
   *[other] { $count } issues
}

editor-modifier-badge = modifier
editor-modifier-warning = A modifier extension changes the meaning of this resource. A system that does not recognise it must refuse to process the resource.
editor-unknown-badge = not in schema
editor-unknown-hint = The schema does not describe this element. It is shown so it is not silently lost, and it is kept on save.

editor-primitive-extension-badge = + extension
editor-primitive-extension-hint = This value carries extensions of its own (a `_` sibling in the JSON). They are kept when you save.

editor-collapse-all = Collapse all

editor-edit-raw = Edit raw
editor-versions = Versions
editor-versions-none = No prior versions.
