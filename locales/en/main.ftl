# Helios FHIR Server — UI message catalog
# Locale: English (en) — SOURCE LOCALE. Every key defined here is the
# canonical set; other locales are expected to provide the same keys.
#
# Syntax: Project Fluent (https://projectfluent.org/). Terms (prefixed with
# `-`) are reusable snippets; messages (bare identifiers) are what the UI
# looks up. Placeables `{ $var }` are interpolated by the caller. Do NOT put
# markup or logic here — translations are data, the template renders them.

## SearchParameter viewer (#238)

sp-heading = Search Parameters
sp-lede = Browse the parameters this server resolves searches against, filtered by base resource type. Stored parameters can be created, edited, and deleted; the registry picks changes up per tenant.
sp-version-label = FHIR version
sp-spec-missing = The full spec bundle (search-parameters-*.json) was not found in the data directory — only the minimal embedded fallback parameters are shown.
sp-rail-label = Resource filter
sp-rail-search = Filter types
sp-rail-recent = Recently used
sp-rail-types = Resource types
sp-rail-all = All Types
sp-facet-type = Type

sp-field-base = Base resource types
sp-field-expression = FHIRPath expression
sp-field-description = Description
sp-field-target = Target types
sp-field-components = Components
sp-status-hint = The loader promotes the spec's draft status to active on load.
sp-note-conflict = Duplicate (base, code) within the same source as { $url } — the registry rejects this collision (DuplicateCode).
sp-note-overrides = Overrides { $url } on (base, code): a Stored definition outranks the spec parameter, so this one resolves searches. The registry logs a WARN naming both URLs.
sp-note-shadowed = Shadowed by { $url } on (base, code): a higher-precedence source resolves searches for this slot.
sp-note-empty-expression = Empty expression: the extractor indexes zero rows, so every search on this parameter silently returns empty.
sp-note-no-target = Reference parameter with no target types: chained search cannot resolve the referenced type.
sp-note-choice-type = Choice-type expression: the extractor rewrites ofType(T) / as T to the concrete element (for example valueQuantity) before evaluating against raw stored JSON.
sp-new = New Search Parameter
sp-edit = Edit
sp-delete = Delete
sp-delete-confirm = Delete this stored search parameter? Searches that use it stop matching once the registry refreshes.

## Compartment viewer & tester (#237)

cmp-heading = Compartments
cmp-lede = The compartment definitions this server routes /{"{"}compartment{"}"}/{"{"}id{"}"}/{"{"}type{"}"} requests with, and a tester that answers: is this type in this compartment, via which parameters, and what search does the server run?
cmp-rail-label = Compartment definitions
cmp-rail-heading = Compartments
cmp-degraded = Compartment definitions could not be loaded from this server right now — the self-call to /CompartmentDefinition failed (with authentication enabled this usually means the outbound service token is missing or invalid). The page retries on the next request.
cmp-rail-note = Definitions are stored resources, seeded from the FHIR spec at startup. Edits and deletions here are tenant-scoped.

cmp-result-member-note = The server resolves the compartment route to this search over the type's reference parameters.
cmp-result-self = ✓ member — the compartment resource itself ({"{"}def{"}"})
cmp-result-self-note = The compartment instance is trivially in its own compartment; the route reads the resource directly.
cmp-result-notmember = ✕ { $type } is not a member of this compartment
cmp-result-notmember-note = The server returns 404 with an OperationOutcome for types that are not compartment members.
cmp-result-fanout = Fans out to { $count } member types
cmp-result-fanout-note = Excluded types are skipped, not failed — the fan-out drops non-member types rather than erroring.
queries-builder-heading = Search Builder
queries-url-label = FHIR search URL
queries-url-placeholder = GET /Patient?name=smith&birthdate=ge1980-01-01
queries-builder-hint = Edit the GET URL directly or through the rows below — they stay in sync. Run executes the search here and records it under Recent; give it a name to keep it in the saved list.
queries-recent = Recent
queries-recent-heading = Recent Searches
queries-recent-empty = No recent searches yet — Run one to record it here.

search-mode-nl = Natural language
search-mode-builder = Visual builder

search-nl-label = Describe the search
search-nl-placeholder = Describe what you're looking for — e.g. patients named Smith born after 1980

search-nl-working = Translating…
search-nl-caveats = Worth knowing:
search-nl-unsupported = That isn't a search this server can run. Try describing the records you want to find.

search-nl-example-1 = Female patients over 65 with a diabetes diagnosis
search-nl-example-2 = Observations from the last 30 days, most recent first
search-nl-example-3 = Encounters at Boston General still in progress

search-setup-heading = Natural-language search is available
search-setup-body = Turn plain-language descriptions into FHIR search queries. It needs an API key for a language model — the server reads it from the environment, and it never reaches this page. Until one is set, use the visual builder below.

editor-must-support-badge = MS
editor-binding-hint = Bound to a value set — codes come from it; strength shown
editor-legend-live = Checked as you type: structure, cardinality, required bindings
editor-legend-save = Checked on save: constraints and terminology
# ViewDefinition's own single-line legend (#843): Save stays permissive
# there, so promising a "checked on save" pass would be misleading — this
# names everything the guided form's per-keystroke pass actually covers,
# folding in the SQL-on-FHIR-specific checks the generic validator above
# does not run.
vd-form-legend-live = Checked as you type: structure, cardinality, required bindings, and FHIRPath syntax / SQL-on-FHIR rules
# The guided form's validity chip (#843), client-side only, while the JSON
# editor's text does not parse at all — short like the chip's other two
# states ("No issues.", "3 issues"), never the longer editor-invalid-json
# sentence.
vd-form-invalid-chip = Invalid JSON
# SQL Query / SQL View's own two-line legend (#840): Save there gates the

editor-modifier-badge = modifier
editor-modifier-warning = A modifier extension changes the meaning of this resource. A system that does not recognise it must refuse to process the resource.
editor-unknown-badge = not in schema
editor-unknown-hint = The schema does not describe this element. It is shown so it is not silently lost, and it is kept on save.

editor-primitive-extension-badge = + extension
editor-primitive-extension-hint = This value carries extensions of its own (a `_` sibling in the JSON). They are kept when you save.
