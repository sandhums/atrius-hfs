# Helios FHIR Server — UI message catalog
# Locale: English (en) — SOURCE LOCALE. Every key defined here is the
# canonical set; other locales are expected to provide the same keys.
#
# Syntax: Project Fluent (https://projectfluent.org/). Terms (prefixed with
# `-`) are reusable snippets; messages (bare identifiers) are what the UI
# looks up. Placeables `{ $var }` are interpolated by the caller. Do NOT put
# markup or logic here — translations are data, the template renders them.
