# Helios FHIR Server — UI message catalog
# Locale: English (en) — SOURCE LOCALE. Every key defined here is the
# canonical set; other locales are expected to provide the same keys.
#
# Syntax: Project Fluent (https://projectfluent.org/). Terms (prefixed with
# `-`) are reusable snippets; messages (bare identifiers) are what the UI
# looks up. Placeables `{ $var }` are interpolated by the caller. Do NOT put
# markup or logic here — translations are data, the template renders them.

## SearchParameter viewer (#238)

sp-heading = Search Parameters
sp-lede = Browse the parameters this server resolves searches against, filtered by base resource type. Stored parameters can be created, edited, and deleted; the registry picks changes up per tenant.
sp-version-label = FHIR version
sp-spec-missing = The full spec bundle (search-parameters-*.json) was not found in the data directory — only the minimal embedded fallback parameters are shown.
sp-rail-label = Resource filter

sp-rail-recent = Recently used
sp-rail-types = Resource types

sp-facet-type = Type

sp-field-base = Base resource types
sp-field-expression = FHIRPath expression
sp-field-description = Description
sp-field-target = Target types
sp-field-components = Components
sp-status-hint = The loader promotes the spec's draft status to active on load.
sp-note-conflict = Duplicate (base, code) within the same source as { $url } — the registry rejects this collision (DuplicateCode).
sp-note-overrides = Overrides { $url } on (base, code): a Stored definition outranks the spec parameter, so this one resolves searches. The registry logs a WARN naming both URLs.
sp-note-shadowed = Shadowed by { $url } on (base, code): a higher-precedence source resolves searches for this slot.
sp-note-empty-expression = Empty expression: the extractor indexes zero rows, so every search on this parameter silently returns empty.
sp-note-no-target = Reference parameter with no target types: chained search cannot resolve the referenced type.
sp-note-choice-type = Choice-type expression: the extractor rewrites ofType(T) / as T to the concrete element (for example valueQuantity) before evaluating against raw stored JSON.
sp-new = New Search Parameter
sp-edit = Edit
sp-delete = Delete
sp-delete-confirm = Delete this stored search parameter? Searches that use it stop matching once the registry refreshes.

## Compartment viewer & tester (#237)

cmp-heading = Compartments
cmp-lede = The compartment definitions this server routes /{"{"}compartment{"}"}/{"{"}id{"}"}/{"{"}type{"}"} requests with, and a tester that answers: is this type in this compartment, via which parameters, and what search does the server run?
cmp-rail-label = Compartment definitions
cmp-rail-heading = Compartments
cmp-degraded = Compartment definitions could not be loaded from this server right now — the self-call to /CompartmentDefinition failed (with authentication enabled this usually means the outbound service token is missing or invalid). The page retries on the next request.
cmp-rail-note = Definitions are stored resources, seeded from the FHIR spec at startup. Edits and deletions here are tenant-scoped.

cmp-result-self = ✓ member — the compartment resource itself ({"{"}def{"}"})
cmp-result-self-note = The compartment instance is trivially in its own compartment; the route reads the resource directly.
cmp-result-notmember = ✕ { $type } is not a member of this compartment
cmp-result-notmember-note = The server returns 404 with an OperationOutcome for types that are not compartment members.
cmp-result-fanout = Fans out to { $count } member types
cmp-result-fanout-note = Excluded types are skipped, not failed — the fan-out drops non-member types rather than erroring.
queries-builder-heading = Search Builder
queries-url-label = FHIR search URL
queries-url-placeholder = GET /Patient?name=smith&birthdate=ge1980-01-01

search-nl-example-3 = Encounters at Boston General still in progress

search-setup-heading = Natural-language search is available

hts-import-invalid-json-error = The submitted body is not valid JSON.

# V3 "stepped" Import layout (#551): three numbered steps — choose source,
# review, result. Step 2 deliberately carries no entry counts: HTS reports
# counts only in the `POST /import` response, so a pre-flight number would
# be invented rather than measured.
hts-import-step-source = Choose source
hts-import-step-review = Review
hts-import-step-result = Result
hts-import-file-hint = JSON only. The file is read in your browser and copied into the Bundle field below; nothing is sent until you submit.

## Slice G — standalone Diagnostics page (design doc §7.9).

## Stacked-card view over CapabilityStatement, TerminologyCapabilities,
## /health, and /metrics — mirrors HFS's Capability Statement page.
## A failing source renders an `hts-degraded-reason-*` warning notice

# Concept information plane (Direction B, "concept-first").
# The concept is a top-level object with its own permalink at
# /ui/hts/concepts?system=...&code=..., rendered as three panels:
# Identity, Mappings (across every stored ConceptMap), and Subsumption.
hts-concept-title = Concept
hts-concept-lede = One code, seen from every angle the terminology server can answer for: what it is, what it maps to, and where it sits in the hierarchy.
hts-concept-open = Open concept
hts-concept-panel-loading = Loading
hts-concept-panel-open = Open this panel

hts-concept-identity-heading = Identity

hts-concept-mappings-heading = Mappings
hts-concept-mappings-direction-forward = Mappings where this concept is the source, across every stored ConceptMap.
hts-concept-mappings-direction-reverse = Mappings where this concept is the target, across every stored ConceptMap.
hts-concept-mappings-switch-forward = Show mappings from this concept
hts-concept-mappings-switch-reverse = Show mappings to this concept
hts-concept-mappings-empty = No ConceptMap maps this concept.
hts-concept-mappings-vocabulary = Mapping vocabulary
hts-concept-mappings-vocabulary-equivalence = equivalence (R4 / R4B)
hts-concept-mappings-vocabulary-relationship = relationship (R5 / R6)
hts-concept-mappings-vocabulary-unknown = Not reported
hts-concept-mappings-unattributable = The server does not attribute reverse-mode matches to a source map, so the origin cannot be shown. Switch to the forward direction to see which ConceptMap each mapping came from.
hts-concept-mappings-origin = Origin map
hts-concept-mappings-column-code = Code

hts-concept-mappings-column-display = Display
hts-concept-mappings-column-mapping = Relationship

hts-concept-relations-heading = Subsumption
hts-concept-relations-lede = Each row is one subsumption check. The ancestor candidate is always sent as code A, so a hierarchy that agrees with itself answers "subsumes" every time.
hts-concept-relation-parent = Parent
hts-concept-relation-child = Child
hts-concept-relation-manual = Compared
hts-concept-relations-column-relation = Relation

hts-concept-subsumes-outcome-subsumed-by = Subsumed by
hts-concept-subsumes-outcome-not-subsumed = Not subsumed
hts-concept-relations-conflict-caveat = The concept lookup reports this hierarchy link but the subsumption check does not confirm it. That usually means the subsumption closure was not rebuilt after the CodeSystem was re-imported; the hierarchy itself survived.
hts-concept-relations-empty = This concept has no parents or children to compare.
hts-concept-relations-dropped = { $n } further comparators were not checked; this panel runs at most 20 subsumption calls per render.
hts-concept-relations-compare-label = Compare with code
hts-concept-relations-compare-placeholder = Another code in this system
hts-concept-relations-compare-hint = The system is pinned to this concept's, so enter the bare code. The check asks whether that code subsumes this one.
hts-concept-relations-compare-submit = Compare

## HTS detail pages -- V3 compact header (#551 Slice B/C/D layout pass).

hts-vs-expand-tree-note = Tree mode returns the whole hierarchy; the pager is flat-mode only.
hts-cm-translate-table-caption = Translate matches returned by the terminology server.
hts-cm-translate-origin-reverse-note = In reverse mode HTS omits originMap, so a match cannot be attributed to a specific concept map. Every Origin cell stays an em-dash by design — it is not a missing value.
