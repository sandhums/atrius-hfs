# MongoDB `search_index` indexes

HFS keeps two kinds of index on the `search_index` collection.

- **Inline** indexes (`idx_search_composite`, `idx_search_resource`) are created at every boot before the server serves. They are cheap to build.
- **Generation-2** indexes (nine partial value indexes named `idx_search_*_v2`, and `idx_search_contained`) are built by HFS **after** boot, in one `createIndexes` command that scans the collection once. MongoDB 4.2 and later do not block reads or writes during the build. When every generation-2 index is ready, HFS drops the nine generation-1 value indexes (`idx_search_string`, `idx_search_token`, ...) and records `search_indexes.generation: 2` in the `schema_version` document.

Why: a generation-1 value index carried one entry for every row of the collection, even rows that had no value of that type, and no value index carried `resource_id`, so every search fetched one document per matching key. Generation-2 indexes are partial (one entry per row that has the value) and end in `resource_id`, so a value-filtered scan is covered. Issues #1059 and #1084 have the measurements.

## `HFS_MONGODB_INDEX_BUILD`

| value | behaviour |
|---|---|
| `background` (default) | Boot returns immediately. The build runs in the background and is logged at `info` when it starts and finishes. |
| `inline` | Boot waits for the build. Use for tests, developer databases and small deployments. |
| `off` | Nothing is built or dropped. Each missing generation-2 index is logged at `warn`. Each generation-1 index still present once generation 2 is complete is also logged at `warn`, naming the `dropIndex` command to remove it. Use when you pre-build in a maintenance window. |

## Upgrading a large deployment

Deploy the binary. The server serves on generation 1 while the build runs. Disk peaks at the size of both generations, then drops when the old ones are removed. Writes are slower during the build by the cost of maintaining both sets. Nothing needs to be scheduled.

To build in a window of your choosing instead, run the pre-build script first; a database that already has every generation-2 index makes the builder a no-op at boot:

    mongosh "$HFS_MONGODB_URL/$HFS_MONGODB_DATABASE" docs/mongodb/search-index-v2.mongosh.js

## If the build fails

The log carries the server's error at `error` level. Nothing has been dropped; searches keep using generation 1. Fix the cause (usually disk) and restart: every step is idempotent, and a completed index is skipped.

If a generation-2 name exists with a different key spec, HFS refuses to build or drop anything and logs both specs. Drop or rename that index by hand. A spec that differs only in the numeric type of its key values (for example one built by mongosh, which stores doubles where HFS stores integers) is not treated as a conflict.

## Downgrading

A binary from before generation 2 creates the nine generation-1 indexes at boot, inline, and will not serve until they exist. If they have been dropped, that boot rebuilds all nine before serving. Before rolling back, recreate them in the background:

    mongosh "$HFS_MONGODB_URL/$HFS_MONGODB_DATABASE" docs/mongodb/search-index-v1-rollback.mongosh.js

Both scripts are generated from `crates/persistence/src/backends/mongodb/search_index_catalog.rs`; a unit test fails if they drift.
