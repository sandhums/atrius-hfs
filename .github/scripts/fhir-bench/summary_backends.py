# Per-leg benchmark diagnostics for the step summary: tuning table, import
# completeness, ES drain status, host load at crud start, "how to read this
# leg" guidance, the result-size cross-check + crud-residue caption, Mongo
# transaction-error heuristic, composite ES sync-failure count, and
# dead-container warnings.
#
# Called from: the `benchmark` job's "Generate step summary" step
# (fhir-benchmark.yml), via:
#   python3 "$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/.github/scripts/fhir-bench/summary_backends.py"
# runs before the Results table (after the header lines) inside that step's
# `{ ... } >> "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY"` group, so its stdout lands at the same
# position this block originally printed at: after the leg header table,
# before the step's own (still inline) Results table and Environment
# paragraph — this prints unconditionally, same as before, regardless of
# whether any *.json summary file exists.
#
# Required environment (exported by the workflow step's env:):
#   BACKEND               matrix.backend
#   IN_PG_SHARED_BUFFERS  inputs.pg_shared_buffers — used only for the
#                         mongodb "How to read this leg" shared_buffers
#                         comparison below; nothing else in the calling
#                         step (including its own still-inline heredoc)
#                         reads it
# Also reads GITHUB_WORKSPACE (set by Actions on every runner, not just this
# step) and, when present, CAPACITY_NEED_MB / CAPACITY_AVAIL_MB /
# CAPACITY_WAIT_S / CAPACITY_MEM_SOURCE — $GITHUB_ENV values "Docker host
# capacity gate" writes before its own early exit, inherited automatically
# like any other $GITHUB_ENV value (no env: mapping needed for those four).
# CAPACITY_MEM_SOURCE (and host-contention.txt's host_mem_source below) name
# which of host-mem.sh's sources (docker-stats / none) that reading actually
# came from — see host-mem.sh's header for why it derives MemAvailable from
# `docker info` + `docker stats` instead of ever reading /proc/meminfo
# (run 36410157709).
#
# Input: the *.txt files "Run benchmark suites" wrote under
# bench-results/<backend>/ — runner-info.txt, import-completeness.txt,
# es-drain.txt, host-contention.txt, search-counts.txt, crud-residue.txt,
# import-mongo-txn-errors.txt, es-sync-metrics-after-drain.txt,
# containers-state.txt. Each section below is skipped, not fatal, when its
# file is absent (e.g. a leg that died before that file was ever written).
